## Introduction

Creating a silo in JSONsilo allows you to securely store and manage your JSON files. This guide will walk you through the steps to create a new silo, and access it using the unique URL provided.

### Step 1: Navigate to Silos dashboard

Click on the "Silos" in the main navigation menu to access the Silos dashboard.

You will see a list of existing silos if you have any. To create a new silo, click on the "Create" or "Create new Silo" button or "Getting Started" if you have no silos yet.

    If you want to create a private silo that requires an [Access Key](/keys/access-keys) for access, select the "Private" option in the access field.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Public Silo" icon="globe">
    If you want to create a public silo that is accessible to anyone with the link, select the "Public" option in the access field.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Create/Upload your JSON file

Once you click on the "Next: Add JSON Data" button, you will be directed to the [JSON Editor](/editor/json-editor) page. You can either create a new JSON file from scratch using the built-in editor or upload an existing JSON file from your computer.

2. **Upload**: Click on the "Upload" tab button to upload a JSON file from your computer. Make sure the file is in valid JSON format.

4. **Save**: After creating or uploading your JSON file, click the "Save" button to save and deploy your silo.
5. **Save & Close**: After creating or uploading your JSON file, click the "Save & Close" button to save and close the editor and you will be redirected to the silo details page.

That's it! You have successfully created a silo in JSONsilo. ✨
