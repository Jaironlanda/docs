__Silo name__: 
Choose a name for your silo that is easy to remember and understand. Rest assured, the silo name will not affect development or any sensitive aspects.

__Region__:
Choose a region close to you to minimize latency. By default, the Free plan is set to Germany (Dusseldorf).

__Access__:
We offer you two types of access for your silo: Private and Public.
- [**Private**](/how-to/manage/private-silo-access): You are required to have an access key to access or read the silo content.
- [**Public**](/how-to/manage/public-silo-access): Allow everyone to access your silo.

__Access Key__: This action is available when private access is selected. You can also generate the access key manually before or after creating a private silo.

__JSON File__: You can choose whether to enter the JSON file manually or upload it.

- **Manual**: Enter the JSON file manually.
- **Upload**: Drag and drop the file or select it by clicking the upload area. After uploading, you can review the JSON file before deploying your silo.
