# Introduction
To avoid confusion between the Access Key and the Manage Key, this guide provides a detailed explanation of their differences, purposes, and use cases.

## Access Key
An Access Key is used to gain entry to a private silo. It is primarily designed for read-only access, ensuring that users can retrieve data securely without the ability to modify or manage the silo.

### Key Features
- Provides secure access to private silos.
- Ensures data integrity by restricting write or management operations.
- Ideal for scenarios where data retrieval is the primary requirement.

### Example Use Case
Imagine you have a private silo containing sensitive data. You can share the Access Key with a trusted user to allow them to view the data without granting them permissions to alter or manage the silo.

## Manage Key
A Manage Key is required when you need to programmatically manage a silo. It provides full control over the silo, enabling you to perform administrative tasks.

### Key Features
- Grants full access to create, update, and delete silos.
- Enables programmatic management of silos through APIs or automation scripts.
- Suitable for developers or administrators managing multiple silos.

### Use Cases
- **List all created silos**: Retrieve a list of all silos under your account.
- **Create a silo**: Programmatically create a new silo for storing data.
- **Update a silo**: Modify the configuration or metadata of an existing silo.
- **Delete a silo**: Remove a silo that is no longer needed.

### Example Use Case
If you are building an application that interacts with multiple silos, you can use the Manage Key to automate the creation, updating, and deletion of silos as part of your workflow.

## Summary
The Access Key and Manage Key serve distinct purposes:
- Use an **Access Key** for secure, read-only access to private silos.
- Use a **Manage Key** for full control and programmatic management of silos.

Understanding these differences ensures that you use the appropriate key for your specific needs, enhancing both security and functionality.
