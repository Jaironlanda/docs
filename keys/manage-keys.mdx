## Best Practices for Managing Manage Keys

- **Keep Your Manage Keys Secret**: Treat your Manage Keys like passwords. Do not share them publicly or expose them in client-side code.
- **Rotate Your Manage Keys Regularly**: Periodically regenerate your Manage Keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store your Manage Keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application.
