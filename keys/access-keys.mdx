## What is an Access Key?

An Access Key is a unique identifier used to access private silos in JSONsilo. When you create a private silo, you need an Access Key to view or modify the data. This ensures that only authorized users can access the silo's contents.

## Best Practices for Managing Access Keys

- **Keep Your Access Keys Secret**: Treat your Access Keys like passwords. Do not share them publicly or expose them in client-side code.
- **Rotate Your Access Keys Regularly**: Periodically regenerate your Access Keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store your Access Keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application.
