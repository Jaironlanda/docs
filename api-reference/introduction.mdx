## Authentication

### API Keys

The JSONSilo Manage API uses API keys for authentication. Every request to the API must include your API key, used to authenticate your requests.

<Note>Remember that your API key is a secret. Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps).</Note>

All API requests should include your API key in an `X-MAN-API` or `x-man-api` HTTP header as follows:

```bash
x-man-api: API_KEY
```

### Generate Manage API Key

To generate or manage an API key, from the console screen, select Key from the drawer menu. This page will list all the keys, including the Access Key used to access the private silo.

Please do not confuse the Access Key with the Manage Key.

- **Access Key**: To access private silo
- **Manage Key**: To mange silo via API
