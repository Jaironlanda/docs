## Authentication

### API Keys

The JSONSilo Manage API uses API keys for authentication. Every request to the API must include your API key, used to authenticate your requests.

<Note>Remember that your API key is a secret. Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps).</Note>

All API requests should include your API key in an `X-MAN-API` or `x-man-api` HTTP header as follows:

```bash
x-man-api: API_KEY
```

#### Making a requests

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace X-MAN-API with your secret API key.

```bash
curl -X GET \
    -H 'X-MAN-API: YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://api.jsonsilo.com/api/v1/manage/[FILE_UUID]
```
