### What is a Silo?

A silo is a storage container for a JSON file. When you upload a JSON file to JSONsilo, it becomes a silo. Each silo has a unique file UUID that you can use to access the JSON file through our API.

### Public vs Private Silo

- **Public Silo**: These silos can be accessed by anyone with the URL. No authentication is required to read the JSON data stored in a public silo.
- **Private Silo**: These silos are restricted and require an **Access Key** for any operations. Only users with the correct Access Key can read the JSON data in a private silo.


### Access Keys vs Manage Keys

- **Access Keys**: These keys are used to authenticate API requests for private silos. They allow you to read the JSON data stored in the silo.
- **Manage Keys**: These keys provide higher-level access, allowing you to perform management operations such as creating, updating, or deleting silos.

### Region Codes

JSONsilo is hosted in multiple regions around the world. Each region has a unique code that is used in the API endpoints to specify where your silo is located.


| Region Code   | Description            |
|---------------|------------------------|
| `api`         | General API region     |
| `sg-01-api`   | Singapore region       |
| `usc-01-api`  | US Central region      |

### File UUID

Each silo is assigned a unique identifier (UUID) that is used to access it via the API. The UUID is **unchangeable** and consists of 32 hexadecimal characters separated by 4 hyphens, making it 36 characters long.
